##### shortDescription
Specifies whether the UI component should load adjacent pages. Applies only if **scrolling**.[mode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/scrolling/#mode) is *"virtual"*.

---
In virtual scrolling mode, pages are loaded on demand. If you set this option to **true**, the adjacent pages are loaded in advance for smoother scrolling. This option can reduce the performance on older devices.
